Alternatively, use

this check.

Potential fix: Your 
project's KGP version 
is typically defined 
in the plugins block 
of the 
`settings.gradle` 
file (C:\Users\Utilisa
teur\Pickupoint\mobile
\android/settings.grad
le), by a plugin with 
the id of org.jetbrain
s.kotlin.android. 
If you don't see a 
plugins block, your 
project was likely 
created with an older 
template version, in 
which case it is most 
likely defined in the 
top-level 
build.gradle file (C:\
Users\Utilisateur\Pick
upoint\mobile\android/
build.gradle) by the 
ext.kotlin_version 
property.
